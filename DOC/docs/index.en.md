This project will show you how to build a simple IoT wireless sensor node/network using Arduino Uno R4 WiFi.

!!! tip "Tip"
    The code in this project is far from perfect. Its main focus is to demonstrate key concepts and implementations of IoT wireless sensor networks from a theoretical perspective. There may be some less elegant parts in the code, and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
