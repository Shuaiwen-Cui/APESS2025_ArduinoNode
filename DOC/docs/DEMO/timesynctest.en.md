# Time Synchronization Test

![](time-sync.jpg)

This test evaluates the time synchronization performance of a wireless sensor network. The sensors are arranged in a circle on the same table, equidistant from the center. A rhythmic tapping is performed at the center's vacant position to analyze peak delays and calculate synchronization performance among sensors. The method used is cross-correlation analysis, which computes the cross-correlation function between different sensors and the master node to determine peak delays.
