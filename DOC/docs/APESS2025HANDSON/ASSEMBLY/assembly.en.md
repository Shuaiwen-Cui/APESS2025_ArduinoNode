Install the sensor shield (Sensor Shield) onto the main control board. Ensure all pins are correctly aligned and securely connected.

!!! warning "Caution"
    Make sure the sensor shield is firmly attached to the main control board and that the pins are aligned, referring to the markings near the pins. All connections should be secure to prevent disconnection during operation.

## 4 MPU6050 Installation

| MCU Pin | MPU6050 Pin |
|----------|-------------|
| VCC      | VCC         |
| GND      | GND         |
| SDA      | SDA         |
| SCL      | SCL         |
| --       | INT         |

As shown in the figure, the MPU6050 sensor needs to be connected to the main control board via the I2C interface. Using the 4-pin cable provided with the MPU6050, connect the VCC pin of the MPU6050 to the VCC pin of the Arduino, the GND pin to GND, the SDA pin to SDA, and the SCL pin to SCL. The INT pin can be left unconnected.

## 5 RF24L01 Module Installation

| Arduino Pin | 6812 RGB LED Pin |
|-------------|------------------|
| V           | V                |
| G           | G                |
| S （D7）    | S                |

Connect the RGB LED to the sensor shield using the associated Dupont wires. Connect the RGB LED's pins to the corresponding pins on the sensor shield.

!!! warning "Caution"
    Ensure the RGB LED is connected correctly, with the V pin to V, G pin to G, and S pin to D7. This will ensure proper operation of the LED for visual feedback.

## 7 SD Module Installation

| Arduino Pin | SD Card Module Pin |
|-------------|--------------------|
| 5V          | VCC                |
| GND         | GND                |
| D10         | CS                 |
| D11         | MOSI               |
| D12         | MISO               |
| D13         | SCK                |

As shown in the figure, the SD card module needs to be connected to the main control board via the SPI interface.

!!! warning "Caution"
    Ensure the connections of the SD card module are correct and secure. If the dupont wires are loose, please replace them or contact technical support.

## 8 Enclosure Assembly

![](node-all.jpg)

!!! warning "Caution"
    This step should be performed after programming is complete to ensure all components can be correctly placed.

- Use the standoffs and bolts to secure the battery box and the mounting board where the main control board is located.

- Put the batteries into the battery box, ensuring they are correctly oriented. Don't press to hard, as it cannot be fully pressed down due to the mismatch of the size of the battery box and the battery.

- Put the whole node into the enclosure, ensuring all components are securely placed and that the enclosure is closed properly.

!!! warning "Caution"
    How the node should be placed inside the enclosure is up to the specific requirements of the experiment being conducted.
